# ShakeFlashLight
Shake Flashlight Service is an Android background service that allows users to toggle their device's flashlight by shaking the phone twice in quick succession. This service continuously monitors the device's accelerometer sensor to detect shakes and uses the device's camera flash as a torch.

# Key Features
Shake Detection: Uses the accelerometer sensor to detect shakes. Only significant shakes are considered to avoid false triggers while carrying the phone. <br>
Flashlight Toggle: Toggles the flashlight on or off when the device is shaken twice within a specified time interval. <br>
Vibration Feedback: Provides haptic feedback when the flashlight is toggled, vibrating for 500 milliseconds. <br>
Foreground Service: Runs as a foreground service with a persistent notification to ensure it continues running in the background. <br>
