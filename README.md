# ShakeFlashLight
 Shake Flashlight Service is an Android background service that allows users to toggle their device's flashlight by shaking the phone twice in quick succession. This service continuously monitors the device's accelerometer sensor to detect shakes and uses the device's camera flash as a torch.
